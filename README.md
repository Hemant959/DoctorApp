## Model Classes
- Patient :-The Patient entity represents an Patient record in your Spring Boot application. It is used to store information about a user's todo, including details such as name, Id,Gender.
- Doctor :-The Doctor entity represents an Doctor record in your Spring Boot application. It is used to store information about a user's todo, including details such as name, Id,Gender.

## Controller Class
# Todo Controller

The `TodoController` is a part of a Spring Boot application responsible for handling TODO-related operations. It defines several RESTful endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting TODO items.

## Endpoints

The `TodoController` provides the following endpoints for managing TODO items:

- **POST** `/post`: Create a new TODO item.

  - Request: Send a JSON object containing the `TODO` item to be created.
  - Response: A message indicating the result of the operation.

- **GET** `/get`: Retrieve a list of all TODO items.

  - Response: Returns a list of TODO items.

- **PUT** `/update`: Update a TODO item.

  - Request: Pass `id` and `name` as query parameters to update the name of a TODO item with the given `id`.
  - Response: A message indicating the result of the update operation.

- **DELETE** `/DELETE`: Delete a TODO item.

  - Request: Pass the `id` as a query parameter to delete the TODO item with the specified `id`.
  - Response: A message indicating the result of the delete operation.

## Usage

The `PatientController` is used to interact with your TODO application by providing a RESTful API. You can use various HTTP clients, such as Postman, cURL, or client libraries, to send requests to these endpoints.

## Service Class
# Todo Service

The `PatientService` is a Spring service class responsible for managing and providing operations related to TODO items in your application. It encapsulates the business logic for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting TODO items.

## Methods

The `TodoService` provides the following methods for managing TODO items:

- `AddTodo(TODO newTodo)`: Add a new TODO item.
  - Parameters: `newTodo` - The new TODO item to be added.
  - Returns: A message indicating the result of the operation.

- `getAll()`: Retrieve a list of all TODO items.
  - Returns: A list of TODO items.

- `UpdateData(Integer id, String name)`: Update the name of a TODO item by ID.
  - Parameters: `id` - The ID of the TODO item to update. `name` - The new name for the TODO item.
  - Returns: A message indicating the result of the update operation.

- `DELETEDATA(Integer id)`: Delete a TODO item by ID.
  - Parameters: `id` - The ID of the TODO item to delete.
  - Returns: A message indicating the result of the delete operation.

## Usage

The `TodoService` is used to provide the core functionality for managing TODO items. It serves as the bridge between the `PateintController` and the underlying data repository (presumably, an `pateintRepo`).
